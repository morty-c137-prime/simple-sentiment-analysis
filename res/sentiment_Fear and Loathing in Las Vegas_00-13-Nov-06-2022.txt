" He grinned, seeming to understand. Luckily, the noise in the car was so awful - between the wind and the radio and the tape machine - that the kid in the back seat couldn't hear a word we were saying. Or could he? How long can we maintain? I wondered. How long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family. Will he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car? If so - well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'll report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs. Jesus! Did I say that? Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me? I glanced over at my attorney, but he seemed oblivious - watching the road, driving our Great Red Shark along at a hundred and ten or so. There was no sound from the back seat. Maybe I'd better have a chat with this boy, I thought. Perhape if I explain things, he'll rest easy. Of course. I leaned around in the seat and gave him a fine big smile . admiring the shape of his skull."By the way," I said. "There's one thing you should probably understand.

The kid in the back looked like he wasready to jump right out of the car and take his chances. Our vibrations were getting nasty - but why? I was puzzled, frustrated. Was there no communication in this car? Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts? Because my story was true. I was certain of that. And it was extremely important, I felt, for the meaning of our journey to be made absolutely clear. We had actually been sitting there in the Polo Lounge - for many hours - drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side and beer chasers. And when the call came, I was ready. The Dwark approached our table cautiously, as I recall, and when he handed me the pink telephone I said nothing, merely listened. And then I hung up, turning to face my attorney.

Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid?".He was laughing again, then he jammed his nose down toward the salt shaker, aiming the thin green roll of a $20 bill straight into what was left of the powder.

" Las Vegas was just up ahead. I could see the strip/hotel skyline looming up through the blue desert ground - haze: The Sahara, the landmark, the Americana and the ominous Thunderbird - a cluster of grey rectangles in the distance, rising out of the cactus. Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close. The objective was the big tower of the Mint Hotel, downtown - and if we didn't get there before we lost all control, there was also the Nevada State prison upstate in Carson City. I had been there once, but only for a talk with the prisoners - and I didn't want to go back, for any reason at all. So there was really no choice: We would have to run the gauntlet, and acid be damned. Go through all the official gibberish, get the car into the hotel garage, work out on the desk clerk, deal with the bellboy, sign in for the press passes - all of it bogus, totally illegal, a fraud on its face, but of course it would have to be done. "KILL THE BODY AND THE HEAD WILL DIE" This line appears in my notebook, for some reason. Perhaps some connection with Joe Frazier. Is he still alive? Still able to talk? I watched that fight in Seattle - horribly twisted about four seats down the aisle from the Governor. A very painful experience in every way, a proper end to the sixties Tim Leary a prisoner of Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria, Bob Dylan clipping coupons in Greenwich Village, both Kennedysmurdered by mutants, Owsley folding napkins on Terminal Island, and finally Cassius/Ali belted incredibly off his pedestal by a human hamburger, a man on the verge of death. Joe Frazier, like Nixon, had finally prevailedfor reasons that people like me refused to understand - at least not out loud. But that was some other era, burned out and long gone from the brutish realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971. A lot of things had changed in those years. And now I was in Las Vegas as the motor sports editor of this fine slick magazine that had sent me out here in the Great Red Shark for some reason that nobody claimed to understand. "Just check it out," they said, "and we'll take it from there.

It's just wonderful to be here with you people. Nobody argued with him. We all understood. In some circles, the "Mint 400" is a far, far better thing than the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby and the Lower Oakland Roller Derby Finals all rolled into one. This race attracts a very special breed, and our man in the Harley T - shirt was clearly one of them.

The woman kept pulling at him. She'd been mooning at his elbows for two hours, and now she was making her move. The man from Life wanted no part of it; he slumped deeper into his crouch. I turned away. It was too horrible. We were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press. And we were gathered here in Las Vegas for a very special assignment: to cover the Fourth Annual "Mint 400" . and when it comes to things like this, you don't fool around. But now - even before the spectacle got under way - there were signs that we might be losing control of the situation. Here we were on this fine Nevada morning, this cool bright dawn on the desert, hunkered down at some greasy bar in a concrete blockhouse & gambling casino called the "Mint Gun Club" about ten miles out of Vegas.

Soon we were staggering up the stairs towards the entrance, laughing stupidly and dragging each other along, like drunks. This is the main advantage of ether: it makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel. total loss of all basic motor skills: blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue - severance of all connection between the body and the brain. Which is interesting, because the brain continues to function more or less normally. you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't controlit. You approach the turnstiles leading into the Circus - Circus and you know that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside. but when you get there, everything goes wrong: you misjudge the distance to the turnstile and slam against it, bounce off and grab hold of an old woman to keep from falling, some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling: "Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine.

This madness goes on and on, but nobody seems to notice. The gambling action runs twenty - four hours a day on the main floor, and the circus never ends.

His eyes were gripped shut and only his head and both kneecaps poked up through the oily green water. I let the song build while I sorted through the pile of fat ripe grapefruit next to the basin.

I could hear the beat cooling down as I moved across the room to my kitbag and fetched up the Mace can. just as my attorney ripped the bathroom door open and started out.

Three fast explosions knocked me off balance. Three deafening, double - action blasts from the .357 in my right hand. Jesus! Firing at nothing, for no reason at all. Bad craziness. I tossed the gun into the front seat of the Shark and stared nervously at the highway. No cars either way; the road was empty for two or three miles in both directions. Fine luck. It would not do to be found in the desert under these circumstances: firing wildly into the cactus from a car full of drugs. And especially not now, on the lam from the Highway Patrol.

I sat down on the bed and casually reached into my satchel for the Mace can . and when I felt my tumb on the Shoot button I was tempted to jerk the thing out and soak her down on general principles, I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary. The last thing I wanted was a fight to the finish, in my own hotel room, with some kind of drug - crazed hormone monster.

" For the first time, I noticed that the room was full of artwork - maybe forty or fifty portraits, some in oil, some charcoal, all more or less the same size and all the same face. They were propped up on every flat surface. The face was vaguely familiar, but I couldn't get a fix on it. It was a girl with a mouth, a big nose and extremely glittering eyes - a demonically sensual face; the kind of overstated, embarrassingly dramatic renderings that you find in the bedrooms of young female art students who get hung up on horses.

Lucy smiled bashfully. There was no more hostility in her. I dropped the Mace can and stood up. We obviously had a serious case on our hands.

After much difficulty, we got back to the room and tried to have a serious talk with Lucy. I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done. She was not right for us - not in this fragile situation. It was bad enough if she were only what she appeared to be - a strange young girl in the throes of a bad psychotic episode - but what worried me far more than that was the likelihood that she would probably be just sane enough, in a few hours, to work herself into a towering Jesus - based rage at the hazy recollection of being picked up and seduced in the Los Angeles International Airport by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, then dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member. I had a terrible vision of Lucy crashing into Barbra Strei - sand's dressing room at the Americana and laying thisbrutal story on her. That would finish us. They would track us down and probably castrate us both, prior to booking I explained this to my attorney, who was now in tears at the idea of sending Lucy away. She was still powerfully twisted, and I felt the only solution was to get her as far as possible from the Flamingo before she got straight enough to remember where she'd been and what happened to her. Lucy, while we argued, was lying on the patio, doing a charcoal sketch of Barbra Streisand. From memory this time. It was a full - faced rendering, with teeth like baseballs and eyes like jellied fire. The sheer intensity of the thing made me nervous. This girl was a walking bomb. God only knows what she might be doing with all that mis - wired energy right now if she didn't have her sketch pad. And what was she going to do when she got straight enough to read The Vegas Vistitor, as I just had, and learn that Streisand wasn't due at the Americana for another three weeks? My attorney finally agreed that Lucy would have to go. The possibility of a Mann Act conviction, resulting in disbarment proceedings and total loss of his livelihood, was a key factor in his decision. A nasty federal rap. Especially for a monster Samoan facing a typical white middle - class jury in Southern California. "They might even call it kidnapping," I said. "Straight to the gas chamber, like Chessman. And even if you manage to beatthat, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Congensual Sodomy." "No!" he shouted. "I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!"
pos: 0.075, neu: 0.771, neg: 0.154, compound: -0.9927, 
I smiled. "That's what Fatty Arbuckle said, and you know what they did to him." "Who?". "Never mind," I said. "Just picture yourself telling a jury that you tried to help this poor girl by giving her LSD and then taking her out to Vegas for one of your special stark - naked back rubs."

He shook his head sadly. "You're right. They'd probably burn me at the goddamn stake. set me on fire right there in the dock. Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days We coaxed Lucy down to the car, telling her that we thought it was about time to "go meet Barbra."
pos: 0.061, neu: 0.735, neg: 0.204, compound: -0.852, 
We had no trouble convincing her that she should take all her artwork, but she couldn't understand why my attorney wanted to bring her suitcase along. "I don't want to embarrass her," she protested. "She'll think I'm trying to move in with her, or something." "No she won't," I said quickly. but that was all I could think of to say. I felt like Martin Bormann. What would happen to this poor wretch when we cut her loose? Jail? White slavery? What would Dr. Darwin do under these circumstances? (Survival of the. fittest? Was that the proper word? Had Darwin ever considered the idea of temporary unfitness? Like "temporary insanity."
pos: 0.081, neu: 0.711, neg: 0.208, compound: -0.9505, 
Could the Doctor have made room in his theory for a thing like LSD?) All this was academic, of course. Lucy was a potentially fatal millstone on both our necks. There was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and hope her memory was fucked. But some acid victims - especially nervous mongoloids - have a strange kind of idiot - sapient capacity for remembering odd details and nothing else. It was possible that Lucy might spend two more days in the grip of total amnesia, then snap out of it with no memory of anything but ourroom number at the Flamingo. . I thought about this. but the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. I wasn't ready for this; it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney. It came down to that. So the problem was to work out a balance, to aim Lucy in a direction that wouldn't snap her mind and provoke a disastrous backlash. She had money. My attorney had ascertained that. "At least $200," he'd said. "And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in."
pos: 0.045, neu: 0.754, neg: 0.201, compound: -0.9896, 
I was reluctant to do this. The only thing worse than turning her loose in Vegas, I felt, was turning her over to "the authorities". and that was clearly out of the question, anyway. Not now. "What kind of goddamn monster are you?".I said. "First you kidnap the girl, then you rape her, and now you want to have her locked up!"
pos: 0.055, neu: 0.728, neg: 0.217, compound: -0.915, 
He shrugged. "It just occurred to me," he said, "that she has no witnesses. Anything she says about us is completely worthless." "Us?".I said. He stared at me. I could see that his head was clearing. The acid was almost gone. This meant that Lucy was probably coming down, too. It was time to cut the cord. Lucy was waiting for us in the car, listening to the radio with a twisted smile on her face. We were standing about ten yards off. Anybody watching us from a distance might have thought we were having some kind of vicious, showdown argurnent about who had "rights to the girl."
pos: 0.023, neu: 0.913, neg: 0.064, compound: -0.5563, 
It was a standard scene for a Vegas parking lot. We finally decided to make her a reservation at the Americana. My attorney ambled over to the car and got her last name under some pretense, then I hurried inside and called the hotel - saying that I was her uncle and that I wanted her to be "treated very gently," because she was an artist and might seem a trifle high - strung. The room clerk assured me they'd give her every courtesy. Then we drove her out to the airport, saying we were going to trade the White Whale in for a Mercedes 600, and my attorney took her into the lobby with all her gear. She was still unhinged and babbling when he led her away. I drove around a corner and waited for him. Ten minutes later he shuffled up to the car and got in. "Take off slowly," he said. "Don't attract any attention."
pos: 0.04, neu: 0.946, neg: 0.014, compound: 0.457, 
When we got out on Las Vegas Boulevard he explained that he'd given one of the airport cab - hasslers a $10 bill to see that his "drunk girlfriend" got to the Americana, where she had a reservation. "I told him to make sure she got there," he said. "You think she will?". He nodded. "The guy said he'd pay the fare with the extra five bucks I gave him, and tell the cabbie to humor her. I told him I had some business to take care of, but I'd be there myself in an hour - and if the girl wasn't already checked in, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out." "That's good," I said. "You can't be subtle in this town."

A good Kristofferson tune was croaking out of the radio. We cruised back to town through the warm dusk, relaxed on the red leather seats of our electric white Coupe de Ville. "Maybe we should take it easy tonight," I said as we flashed past the Tropicana. "Right," he said. "Let's find a good seafood restaurant and some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon."

I muttered. "Excuse me?".said the clerk. I hung up. My attorney was doing the Big Spit again, in the bathroom. I walked out on the balcony and stared at the pool, this kidney-shaped bag of bright water that shimmered outside our suite. I felt like Othello. Here I'd only been in town a few hours, and we'd already laid the groundwork for a classic tragedy. The hero was doomed; he had already sown the seed of his own downfall. But who was the Hero of this filthy drama? I turned away from the pool and confronted my attorney, now emerging from the bathroom and wiping his mouth with a towel. His eyes were glazed and limpid. "This goddamn mescaline," he muttered. "Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure? Maybe mix it up with Rolaids, or something?". "Othello used Dramamine," I said. He nodded, hanging the towel around his neck as he reached out to flip on the TV set. "Yeah, I heard about those remedies. Your man Fatty Arbuckle used olive oil." "Lucy called," I said. "What?".He sagged visibly - like an animal taking a bullet. "I just got the message from the desk. She's at the Americana, room 1600. and she wants us to call."

He stared at me. and just then the phone rang. I shrugged and picked it up. There was no point trying to hide. She had found us, and that was enough. "Hello," I said. It was the room clerk again. "Mister Duke?". "Yes." "Hello, Mister Duke. I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago, but I thought I should call again, because I was won dering . . "What?".I sensed things closing down on us.

I yelled. "On the goddamn television!" "Oh. yes. yes," he said. "This terrible war. When will it end?". "Tell me," I said quietly. "What do you want?". "Of course," he said, snapping back to his desk-clerk tone.

"Why was she crying?". "Well. ah. she didn't say, Mister Duke. But since I knew the nature of your work I thought. " "I know," I said quickly.

"Well. certainly," he said. "We're always happy to cooperate with the police. just as long as there won't be any rouble. for us, I mean." "Don't worry," I said. "You're protected. Just treat this or woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble." "What?".He seemed to be stuttering. "Ah. yes, yes, I see what you meen. yes. so you'll be responsible then?". "Of course," I said. "And now I have to get back to the news." "Thank you," he muttered. "Send the ice," I said, and hung up. My attorney was smiling peacefully at the TV set. "Good work," he said.

He laughed again. "I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?". I nodded. It made no sense at all, but I knew it was true. Drug reasoning. The rhythms were brutally clear - and, to him, they made excellent sense. He was slumped in the chair, concentrating on Mission Im possible. I thought for a while, then stood up and began stuffing things into my suitcase. "What are you doing?".he asked. "Never mind," I said. The zipper stuck momentarily, butl yanked it shut. Then I put on my shoes. "Walt a minute," he said. "Jesus, you're not leaving?". I nodded. "You're goddamn right, I'm leaving. But don't worry. I'll stop at the desk on my way out.

I laughed, tossing my luggage together in a lump at the foot of the bed while I sat down to finish my drink. I actually intended to leave. I didn't really want to, but I figured that nothing I could possibly do with this gig was worth the risk of tangled up with Lucy. No doubt she was a beautiful person, if she ever got straight. very sensative, with a secret reserve karma undernenth her Pit Bull act; a great talent with fine instincts. Just a heavy little gal who unfortunately went stone crazy somewhere prior to her eighteenth birthday. I had nothing personal against her. But I knew she was perfectly capable - under these circumstances - of sending us both to prison for at least twenty years, on the strength of some heinous story we would probably never even hear until she took the stand: "Yessir, those two men over there in the dock are the ones who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel . . "And what did they do then, Lucy?". "Well, sir, I can't rightly remember . . "Indeed? Well, perhaps this document from the District At torney's files will refresh your memory, Lucy. This is the statement you made to Officer Squane shortly after you were found wandering naked in the desert near Lake Mead." "I don't know for sure what they done to me, but I remem ber it was horrible. One guy picked me up in the Los Angeles airport; he's the one who gave me the pill. and the other one met us at the hotel; he was sweating real bad and he talked so fast that I couldn't understand what he wanted. No sir, I don't recall exactly what they did to me at that point, because I was still under the influence of that drug. yessir, the LSD they gave me. and I think I was naked for a long time, maybe the whole time they had me there. I think it was evening, because I remember they had the news on. Yessir, Walter Cronkite, I remember his face all through it. " No, I was not ready for this. No jury would doubt her testi mony, especially when it came stuttering out through a fog of tears and obscene acid flashbacks. And the fact that she couldn't recall precisely what we had done to her would make it impossible to deny. The jury would know what we'd done. They would have read about people like us in the $2.95 paper backs: Up To The Hilt and Only Skin Deep, . and seen your type in the $5 fuck-flicks. And of course we could'nt possibly taking the stand in our own defense - not after they'd cleaned out the trunk of the Whale: "And I'd like to point out, Your Honor, that, our Prosecution Exhibits A through Y are available to the jury - yes, this incredible collection of illegal drugs and narcotics which the defendants had in their possession at the time of their arrests and forcible seizure by no less than nine officers, six of whom are still hospitalized. and also Exhibit Z, sworn testimony by three professional narcotics experts selected by the president of the National District Attorneys' Conference - which was seriously embarrassed by the defendants' attempts to infiltrate, disrupt and pervert their annual convention. these experts have testified that the drug cache in the possession of these defendants at the time of the arrests was enough to kill an entire platoon of United States Marines. and gentlemen, I use the word kill with all due respect for the fear and loathing I'm sure it provokes in every one of you when you reflect that these degenerate rapists used this galaxy of narcotics to completely destroy the mind and morals of this once-innocent teenager, this ruined and de graded young girl who now sits before you in shame . yes, they fed this girl enough drugs to scramble her brains so hor ribly that she can no longer even recall the filthy details of that orgy she was forced to endure. and then they used her, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for their own unspeakable ends!"

We were approaching the Circus-Circus at high speed and the Oklahoma car was veering left, trying to muscle into the turn lane. I stomped the Whale into passing gear and we ran fender to fender for a moment. He wasn't up to hitting me; there was horror in his eyes. The man in the back seat lost control of himself. lunging across his wife and snarling wildly: "You dirty bastards!

He seemed ready to leap out the window and into our car, crazy with rage. Luckily the Ford was a two-door. He couldn't get out. We were coming up to the next stoplight and the Ford was still trying to move left. We were both running full bore. I glanced over my shoulder and saw that we'd left the other traffic far behind; there was a big opening to the right. So I mashed on the brake, hurling my attorney against the dash board, and in the instant the Ford surged ahead I cut across his tail and zoomed into a side-street. A sharp right turn across three lanes of traffic. But it worked. We left the Ford stalled in the middle of the intersection, hung in the middle of a screeching left turn. With a little luck, he'd be arrested for reckless driving. My attorney was laughing as we careened in low gear, with the light sout, through a dusty tangle of backstreets behind the Desert Inn. "Jesus Christ," he said. "Those Okies were getting excited.

He was clinging to the top of the windshield. and suddenly he was doing the Big Spit again, leaning over the side. I refused to slow down until I was sure nobody was following us - especially that Oklahoma Ford: those people were definitely dangerous, at least until they calmed down. Would they report that terrible quick encounter to the police? Probably not. It had happened too fast, with no witnesses, and the I were pretty good that nobody would believe them anyway. The idea that two heroin pushers in a white Cadillac convertible would be dragging up and down the Strip, abusing total strangers at stoplights, was prima facie absurd. Not even Sonny Liston ever got that far out of control. We made another turn and almost rolled again. The Coupe de Ville is not your ideal machine for high speed cornering in residential neighborhoods. The handling is very mushy. unlike the Red Shark, which had responded very nicely to situations requiring the quick four-wheel drift. But the Whale Bad of cutting loose at the critical moment - had a tendency to dig in, which accounted for that sickening "here we go' sensation.

" "We'll see," I said, moving around to the rear with the air- hose. In truth, I was nervous. The two front ones were tighter than snare drums; they felt like teak wood when I tapped on them with the rod. But what the hell? I thought. If they ex plode, so what? It's not often that a man gets a chance to run terminal experiments on a virgin Cadillac and four brand- new $80 tires. For all I knew, the thing might start cornering like a Lotus Elan. If not, all I had to do was call the VIP agency and have another one delivered. maybe threaten them with a lawsuit because all four tires had exploded on me, while driving in heavy traffic. Demand an Eldorado, next time, with four Michelin Xs. And put it all on the card. charge it to the St Louis Browns. As it turned out, the Whale behaved very nicely with the altered tire pressures. The ride was a trifle rough; I could feel every pebble on the highway, like being on roller skates in a gravel pit, but the thing began cornering in a very stylish manner, very much like driving a motorcycle at top speed in a hard rain: one slip and ZANG, over the high side, cartwheel ing across the landscape with your head in your hands. ••• About thirty minutes after our brush with the Okies we pulled into an all-night diner on the Tonopah highway, on the kirts of a mean/scag ghetto called "North Las Vegas.
pos: 0.103, neu: 0.817, neg: 0.08, compound: 0.8073, 
" Which is actually outside the city limits of Vegas proper. North Vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the Strip, and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places around Casino Center. This is Nevada's answer to East St. Louis - a slum and a graveyard, last stop before permanent exile to Ely or Winnemuca. North Vegas is where you go if you're a hooker turning thirty and the syndicate men on the Strip decide you're no longer much good for business out there with the high rollers . or if you're a pimp with bad credit at the Sands. or what they still call, in Vegas, "a hophead.
pos: 0.044, neu: 0.821, neg: 0.135, compound: -0.888, 
" This can mean almost anything from a mean drunk to a junkie, but in terms of commercial acceptability, it means you're finished all the right places. The big hotels and casinos pay a lot of muscle to make sure high rollers don't have even momentary hassles with "undesirables.
pos: 0.112, neu: 0.822, neg: 0.066, compound: 0.5106, 
" Security in a place like Caesar's Palace is super tense and strict. Probably a third of the people on the floor at given time are either shills or watchdogs. Public drunks known pickpockets are dealt with instantly - hustled out parking lot by Secret Service type thugs and given a impersonal lecture about the cost of dental work and of trying to make a living with two broken erms. The "high side" of Vegas is probably the most closed society west of Sicily - and it makes no difference, in terms of the lay life-style of the place, whether the Man at the Top is Lucky Luciano or Howard Hughes. In an economy where Tom Jones can make $75,000 a week for two shows a night at Caeser's, the palace guard is indispensable, and they don't care who signs their paychecks. A gold mine like Vegas breeds it's own army, like any other gold mine. Hired muscle tends to accumulate in fast layers around money/power poles. and big money, in Vegas, is synonymous with the Power to protect it. So once you get blacklisted on the Strip, for any reason at all, you either get out of town or retire to nurse your act along, on the cheap, in the shoddy limbo of North Vegas. out there with the gunsels, the hustlers, the drug cripples and all the other losers. North Vegas, for instance, is where you go if you need to score smack before midnight with no refer ences. But if you're looking for cocaine, and you're ready up front with some bills and the proper code words, you want to stay on the Strip and get next to a well-connected hooker, which will take at least one bill for starters. And so much for all that. We didn't fit the mold. There is no formula for finding yourself in Vegas with a white Cadillac full of drugs and nothing to mix with properly. The Fillmore style never quite caught on here. People like Sinatra and Dean Martin are still considered "far out" in Vegas. The "underground newspaper" here - the Las Vegas Free Press - is a cautious echo of The People's World, or maybe the National Guardian. A week in Vegas is like stumbling into a Time Warp, a regression to the late fifties. Which is wholly understandable when you see the people who come here, the Big Spenders from places like Denver and Dallas. Along with National Elks Club conventions (no niggers allowed) and the All-West Volunteer Sheepherders' Rally. These are people who go abso lutely crazy at the sight of an old hooker stripping down to her pasties and prancing out on the runway to the big-beat sound of a dozen 50-year-old junkies kicking out the jams on "September Song.

I was looking for a copy of the Los Angeles Times, for news of the outside world, but a quick glance at the newspaper racks amde a bad joke of that notion. They don't need the Times in North Vegas.

"Namath Quits Jets to be Governor of Alabama". and a speculative piece on page 46 about a rookie sensation Harrison Fire, out of Grambling: runs the hundred in nine flat, 344 pounds and still growing.

" Indeed. There is always room on TV for a man who can beat people to jelly in nine flat. But not many of these gathered, on this night, in the North Star Coffee Lounge. We had the place to ourselves - which proved to be fortunate, because we'd eaten two more pellets of mescaline on way over, and the effects were beginning to manifest. My attorney was no longer vomiting, or even acting sick. He ordered coffee with the authority of a man long accustmed to quick service. The waitress had the appearance of a hooker who had finally found her place in life. She was definitely in charge here, and she eyed us with obvious disapproval as we settled onto our stools. I was'nt paying much attention. The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms. There are some you go into - in this line of work - that you know will be heavy. The details don't matter. All you know, for sure, is that your brain starts humming with brutal vibes as you approach the front door. Something wild and evil is about to happen; and it's going to involve you. But there was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard. The waitress was passively hostile, but I was accustomed to that. She was a big woman. Not fat, but large in every way, long sinewy arms and a brawler's jawbone. A burned-out caricature of Jane Russell: big head of dark hair, face slashed with lipstick and a 48 Double-E chest that was probably spectacular about twenty years ago when she might have been a Mama for the Hell's Angels chapter in Berdoo. but now she was strapped up in a giant pink elastic brassiere that showed like a bandage through the sweaty white rayon of her uniform. Probably she was married to somebody, but I didn't feel like speculating. All I wanted from her, tonight, was a cup of black coffee and a 29 cent hamburger with pickles and onions. No hassles, no talk - just a place to rest and re - group. I wasn't even hungry. My attorney had no newspaper or anything else to compel his attention. So he focused, out of boredom, on the waitress. She was taking our orders like a robot when he punched through her crust with a demand for "two glasses of ice water - with ice.

" My attorney drank his in one long gulp, then asked for an other. I noticed that the waitress seemed tense. Fuck it, I thought. I was reading the funnies. About ten minutes later, when she brought the hamburg ers, I saw my attorney hand her a napkin with something printed on it. He did it very casually, with no expression at all on his face. But I knew, from the vibes, that our peace was about to be shattered. "What was that?".I asked him. He shrugged, smiling vaguely at the waitress who was standing about ten feet away, at the end of the counter, keeping her back to us while she pondered the napkin. Finally she turned and stared. then she stepped resolutely forward and tossed the napkin at my attorney. "What is this?".she snapped. "A napkin," said my attorney. There was a moment of nasty silence, then she began screaming: "Don't give me that bullshit!

My attorney picked up the napkin, looked at what he'd written, then dropped it back on the counter. "That's the name of a horse I used to own," he said calmly. "What's wrong with you?". "You sonofabitch!" she screamed. "I take a lot of shit in place, but I sure as hell don't have to take it off a spic pimp!"

Jesus! I thought. What's happening? I was watching the woman's hands, hoping she wouldn't pick up anything sharp and heavy. I picked up the napkin and read what the bastard printed on it, in careful red letters: "Back Door Beauty?".The question mark was emphasized. The woman was screaming again: "Pay your bill and get hell out!

You want me to call the cops?". I reached for my wallet, but my attorney was already on feet, never taking his eyes off the woman. then he reached under his shirt, not into his pocket, coming up suddenly with the Gerber Mini-Magnum, a nasty silver blade the the waitress seemed to understand instantly. She froze: her eyes fixed wildly on the blade. My attorney, watching her, moved about six feet down the aisle and the receiver off the hook of the pay phone. He sliced it off, then brought the receiver back to his stool and sat down. The waitress didn't move. I was stupid with shock, not whether to run or start laughing. "How much is that lemon meringue pie?".my attorney's voice was casual, as if he had just wandered into and was debating what to order. "Thirty five cents!" the woman blurted. Her eyes were turgid with fear but her brain was apparently functioning on some basic motor survival leveL My attorney laughed. "I mean the whole pie," he said. She moaned.

Duke: A taco on a bun. Att'y: I betcha your tacos are just hamburgers with a shell sad of a bun. Waitress: I don't know Att'y: You just started working here? Waitress: Today. Att'y: I thought so, I've never saw you here before. You go school around here? Waitress: No, I don't go to school. Duke: Oh? Why not? Are you sick? Att'y: Never mind that. We came here for tacos. [Pause.] Att'y: As your attorney I advise you to get the chiliburger. a hamburger with chili on it. Duke: That's too heavy for me. Att'y: Then I advise you to get a taco burger, try that one. Duke:. the taco has meat in it. I'll try that one. And coffee now. Right now. So I can drink it while I'm waiting. Waitress: That's all you want, one taco burger?

Duke: Yeah. Att'y: We're in Boulder City, huh? Or very close to it? Duke: I don't know. Waitress: There it is. That sign says Boulder City, OK. Aren't you from Nevada? Att'y: No. We've never been here before. Just traveling through. Waitress: You just go straight up this road here. Att'y: Any action up there in Boulder City? Waitress: Don't ask me. I don't. Att'y: Any gambling there? Waitress: I don't know, it's just a little town. Duke: Where is the casino? Waitress: I don't know. Att'y: Wait a minute, where are you from? Waitress: New York. Att'y: And you've just been here a day. Waitress: No, I've been here for a while. Att'y: Where do you go around here? Say you wanted to go swimming or something like that? Waitress: In my backyard. Att'y: What's the address? Waitress: Um, go to the. ah. the pool's not open yet. Att'y: Let me explain it to you, let me run it down just briefly if I can. We're looking for the American Dream, and we were told it was somewhere in this area. . Well, we're here looking for it, 'cause they sent us out here all the way from San Francisco to look for it. That's why they gave us this white Cadillac, they figure that we could catch up with it in that. Waitress: Hey Lou, you know where the American Dream is? Att'y (to Duke): She's asking the cook if he knows where the American Dream is. Waitress: Five tacos, one taco burger. Do you know where the American Dream is? Att'y: Well, we don't know, we were sent out here from Francisco to look for the American Dream, by a magazine to cover it. Lou: Oh, you mean a place. Att'y: A place called the American Dream. Lou: Is that the old Psychiatrist's Club? Waitress: I think so. Att'y: The old Psychiatrist's Club? Lou: Old Psychiatrist's Club, it's on Paradise . . Are you serious? Att'y: Oh, no honest, look at that car, I mean, do I look like own a car like that? Lou: Could that be the old Psychiatrist's Club? It was a discoteque place. Att'y: Maybe that's it. Waitress: It's on Paradise and what? Lou: Ross Allen had the old Psychiatrist's Club. Is he the owner now? Duke: I don't know. Att'y: All we were told was, go till you find the American Dream. Take this white Cadillac and go find the American Dream. It's somewhere in the Las Vegas area. Lou: That has to be the old. Att'y:. and it's a silly story to do, but you know, that's we get paid for. Lou: Are you taking pictures of it, or. Att'y: No, no--no pictures. Lou:. or did somebody just send you on a goose chase? Att'y: It's sort of a wild goose chase, more or less, but personally we're dead serious. Lou: Thas to be the old Psychiatrist's Club, but the only people who hang out there is a bunch of pushers, peddlers, up wners, and all that stuff. Att'y: Maybe that's it. Is it a night-time place or is it an all day. Lou: Oh, honey, this never stops. But it's not a casino. Att'y: What kind of place is it? Lou: It's on Paradise, uh, the old Psychiatrist's Club's on Paradise. Att'y: Is that what it's called, the old Psychiatrist's Club? Lou: No, that is what it used to be, but someone bought it. but I didn't hear about it as the American Dream, it was something like, associated with, uh . it's a mental joint, where all the dopers hang out. Att'y: A mental joint? You mean like a mental hospital? Lou: No, honey, where all the dope peddlers and all the pushers, everybody hangs out. It's a place where all the kids are potted when they go in, and everything. but it's not called what you said, the American Dream. Att'y: Do you have any idea what it might be called? Or more or less where it might be located? Lou: Right off of Paradise and Eastern. Waitress: But Paradise and Eastern are parallel. Lou: Yeah, but I know I come off of Eastern, and then I go to Paradise Waitress: Yeah I know it, but then that would make it off Paradise around the Flamingo, straight up here. I think somebody's handed you a Att'y: We're staying at the Flamingo. I think this place you're talking about and the way you're describing it, I think that maybe that's it. Lou: It's not a tourist joint. Att'y: Well, that's why they sent me. He's the writer: I'm the bodyguard. 'Cause I figure it will be. Lou: These guys are nuts. these kids are nuts. Att'y: That's OK. Waitress: Yeah, they got new laws. Duke: Twenty-four-hour-a-day violence? Is that what we're saying? Lou: Exactly. Now here's the Flamingo. Oh, I can't show you this; I can tell you better my way. Right up here at the first gas station is Tropicana, take a right. Att'y: Tropicana to the right. Lou: The first gas station is Tropicana. Take a right on Tropicana and take this way. right on Tropicana, right on Paradice, you'll see a big black building, it's all painted black real weird looking. Att'y: Right on Tropicana, right on Paradise, black building. Lou: And there's a sign on the side of the building that says Psychiatrist's Club, but they're completely remodeling it and everything. Att'y: All right, that's close enough Lou: If there's anything I can do for ya, honey. I don't know if that's even it or not. But it sounds like it is. I think you boys are on the right track. Att'y: Right. That's the best lead we've had for two days, we've been asking people all around. Lou:. I could make a couple calls and sure as hell find out. Att'y: Could you? Lou: Sure I'll call Allen and ask him. Att'y: Gee, I'd appreciate that if you could. Waitress: When you go down to Tropicana, it's not the first gas station, the second. Lou: There's a big sign right down the street here, it says Tropicana Avenue. Make a right, and when you get to Paradice make another right. Att'y: OK. Big black building, right on Paradise: twenty-four-hour-a-day violence, drugs Waitress: See, here's Tropicana, and this is Boulder Highway that goes clear down like that. Duke: Well, that's pretty far into town then. Waitress: Well, here's Paradise split up somewhere around there. There's Paradice. Paradise. Yeah, we're down in here. See, this is Boulder Highway. and Tropicana. Lou: Well, that's not it, that bartender in there is a pothead too. Att'y: Yeah, well, it's a lead. Lou: You gonna be glad you stopped here, boys. Duke: Only if we find it. Att'y: Only if we write the article and get it in. Waitress: Well, why don't you come inside and sit down? Duke: We're trying to get as much sun as we can. Att'y: She's going to make a phone call to find out where it Is. Duke: Oh. OK, well, let's go inside.

But by this time I was far down the parkway, easing into the turn lane for a left at Flamingo Road. Back to the hotel, to take stock. There was every reason to believe I was heading for trouble, that I'd pushed my luck a bit far. I'd abused every rule Vegas lived by-burning locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only hope now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess, with our gig, that nobody in a position to bring the hammer down on us could possibly believe it. Particularily not since we'd signed in with the Police Conference. When you bring an act into this town, you want to bring it in heavy. Don't waste any time with cheap shucks and misde minors.

Totally harmless; he just wanders around the country looking whatever it was that we all thought we'd nailed down in in the Sixties-sort of an early Bob Zimmerman trip. On a trip from Chicago to L.A., he got curious about Vegas and decided to have a look at it. Just passing through, strolling and digging the sights on the Strip. no hurry, why rush?

Our stringer in Manaus was dispatched upriver, to locate and hire a native attorney conversant in Jibaro, but the search has been hampered by serious communications problems. There is in fact grave concern, in our Rio office, that the widow of the aforementioned Manaus stringer might obtain a ruinous judgment-due to bias in local courts-far larger than any thing a jury in our own country would consider reasonable or even sane. Indeed. But what is sane? Especially here in "our own country"-in this doomstruck era of Nixon. We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled the Sixties. Uppers are going out of style. This was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling "con sciousness expansion" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him too seriously. After West Point and the Priesthood, LSD must have seemed entirely logical to him. but there is not much satisfaction in knowing that he blew it very badiy for himself, because he took too many oth ers down with him. Not that they didn't deserve it: No doubt they all Got What Was Coming To Them. All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding fot three bucks a hit. But their failure is ours, too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped to create. a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody-or at least some force-is tending that Light at the end of the tunnel. This is the same cruel and paradoxically benevolent bullshit has kept the Catholic Church going for so many centuries. It is also the military ethic. a blind faith in some higher and wiser "authority."

The An- blew it in 1965, at the Oakland-Berkeley line, when they acted on Barger's hardhat, con-boss instincts and attacked the front ranks of an anti-war march. This proved to be an historic schism in the then Rising Tide of the Youth Movement of the Sixties. It was the first open break between the Greasers and the Longhairs, and the importance of that break can be read in the history of SDS, which eventually destroyed in the doomed effort to reconcile the interests of the 'working class biker/dropout types and the upper/mid Berkeley/student activists. Nobody involved in that scene, at the time, could possibly have foreseen the Implications of the Ginsberg/Kesey failure to pursuade the Hell's Angels to join forces with the radical Left from Berkeley. The final split came at Altamont, four years later, but by that time it had long been clear to everybody except a handful of rock industry dopers and the national press. The orgy of violence at Altamont merey dramatized the problem. The realities were already fixed; the illness was understood to be terminal, and the energies of The Movement were long since aggressively dissipated by the rush to self-preservation. Ah; this terrible gibberish. Grim memories and bad flash backs, looming up through the time/fog of Stanyan Street. no solace for refugees, no point in looking back. The question, as always, is now.? I was slumped on my bed in the Flamingo, feeling dangerously out of phase with my surroundings. Something ugly was about to happen. I was sure of it. The room looked like the site of some disastrous zoological experiment involving whiskey and gorillas. The ten-foot mirror was shattered, but still hanging together - bad evidence of that afternoon when my attorney ran amok with the coconut hammer, smashing mirror and all the lightbulbs. We'd replaced the lights with a package of red and blue Christmas tree lights from Safeway, but there was no hope of saving the mirror. My attorney's bed looked like a burned- rat's nest. Fire had consumed the top half, and the rest a mass of wire and charred stuffing. Luckily, the maids had'nt come near the room since that awful confrontation on Tuesday. I been asleep when the maid came in that morning. We'd forgotten to hang out the "Do Not Disturb" sign. so she wandered into the room and startled my attorney, who kneeling, stark naked, in the closet, vomiting into his shoes. thinking he was actually in the bathroom, and then suddenly looking up to see a woman with a face like Mickey Rooney staring down at him, unable to speak, trembling with fear and confusion. She was holding that mop like an axe-handle," he said "So I came out of the closet in a kind of running crouch, vomiting, and hit her right at the knees. it was pure instinct; I thought she was ready to kill me . and then, she screamed, that's when I put the icebag on her mouth."

The TV set, hissing at top volume on a nonexistent channel. I could barely hear the woman's cries as she struggled to get the icebag away from her face. but she was no match for my attorney's naked bulk, and he finally managed to pin her in a corner behind the TV set, clamping his hands on her throat while she babbled I.

"What made you do it?".I asked her. "Who paid you off?". "Nobody!" she wailed. "I'm the maid!" "You're lying!" shouted my attorney. "You were after the evidence!

"Bullshit!" said my attorney. "You're just as much a part of it as they are." "Part of what?". "The dope ring," I said. "You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?". She stared at us, trying to speak but only blubbering. "I know you're cops," she said finally. "But I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear!

"You'll be contacted," I said. "It'll take about a week. But keep your eyes open and try to act normal. Can you do that?". "Oh, yes sir!" she said. "Will I see you gentlemen again?".She grinned sheepishly. "After this, I mean "No," said my attorney. "They sent us down from Carson City. You'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock.

"Inspector Rock will take care of that," I said. "It'll all be in cash: a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month." "Oh Lord!" she exclaimed. "I'd do just about anything for that!"

They were still standing there when I drove off in the Whale. The geek had brought it up at exactly the right moment. I gave him a five-dollar bill and hit the street with a stylish screech of rubber. It was all ovet now. I drove across to the Flamingo and loaded all my luggage into the car. I tried to put the top up, for privacy, but something was wrong with the motor. The generator light had been on, fiery red, ever since I'd driven the thing into Lake Mead on a water test. A quick run along the dashboard disclosed that every circuit in the car was to tally fucked. Nothing worked. Not even the headlights-and when I hit the air conditioner button I heard a nasty explosion under the hood. The top was jammed about halfway up, but I decided to try for the airport. If this goddamn junker wouldn't run right, I could always abandon it and call a cab. To hell with this gar bage from Detroit. They shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. The sun was coming up when I got to the airport. I left the Whale in the VIP parking lot. A kid about fifteen years old checked it in, but I refused to answer his questions. He was very excited about the overall condition of the vehicle. "Holy God!" he kept shouting. "How did this happen?".He kept moving around the car, pointing at various dents, rips and crushed places. "I know," I said. "They beat the shit out of it. This is a ter rible goddamn town for driving around in convertibles. The worst time was right out on the Boulevard in front of the Sahara.

I felt a bit guilty about leaving him to deal with the car. There was no way explain the massive damage. It was finished, a wreck, totaled out. Under normal circumstances I would have been seized and arrested when l tried to turn it in. but not at this of the morning, with only this kid to deal with. I was, all, a "VIP."

I checked all my luggage through the chute. All but the satchel, which was full of drugs. And the .357. Did they have the goddamn metal detector system in this airport? I strolled around to the boarding gate and tried to look casual while I cased the area for black boxes. None were visible.

When I finally put this together I felt much better about the health of my own brain EVERYTHING seems to be ready. Are you Ready? Ready? Well, why not? This is a heavy day in Vegas. A thousand cops are checking out of town, scurrying through the airport in groups of three and six. They are heading back home. The drug conference is finished. The Airport Lounge is humming with mean talk and bodies. Short beers and Bloody Marys, here and there a victim of chest rash rubbing Mexsana under the armpit straps of a thick shoulder holster. No point hiding this business any longer. Let it all hang out. or at least get some air to it. Yes, thank you kindly. . I think I busted a button on my trousers. I hope they don't fall down.

Dr. Bboor, the ship's chaplain, presided over tense funeral services at dawn on the flight deck. The 4th Fleet Service Choir sang "Tom Thumb's Blues". and then, while the ship's bells tolled frantically, the remains of the five were set afire in a gourd and hurled into the Pacific by a hooded officer known only as "The Commander.
